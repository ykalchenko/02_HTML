    <h1>Art and engraving on United States banknotes</h1>
    <hr>
    <small>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</small>
    <p>In early 18th century <a href="Colonial-America.html" title="The colonial history of the United States covers the history of European colonization of North America from the early 17th century until the incorporation of the Thirteen Colonies into the United States of America, after the War of Independence.">Colonial America</a>, <a href="Engraving.html" title="Engraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a burin.">engravers</a> began experimenting with copper plates as an alternative medium to wood. Applied to the production of paper currency, copper-plate engraving allowed for greater detail and production during printing. It was the transition to steel engraving that enabled banknote design and printing to rapidly advance in the United States during the 19th century.</p>

        <p>The first issue of government-authorized paper currency in America was printed by the <a href="" title="The Province of Massachusetts Bay was a colony in British America which became one of the thirteen original states of the United States.">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> in 1690.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> This first issue, dated 10 December 1690, was printed from an engraved copper plate with four subjects to a sheet.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The first engraver identified in archival records was John Coney who appears to have been paid 30&pound; on 12 March 1703<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> to engrave three copper plates for the Massachusetts issue dated 21 November 1702.<sup  id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Given the many design similarities between the 1690 note and those engraved by Coney in 1702, there has been speculation that he may have engraved the earlier note.

        <h2 id="p2">Engraving and printing at the U.S. Treasury</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The first series of Federally-issued United States banknotes was authorized by Congressional acts on 17 July 1861 (12 Stat. 259) and 5 August 1861 (12 Stat. 313). While the Demand Notes were issued from the United States Treasury, they were engraved and printed elsewhere. In 1861, in fact until the mid-1870s, the Treasury Department lacked the facilities or infrastructure to engrave and print the bulk of it financial paper and therefore relied on external contracts with private bank note companies. By means of a Congressional act dated 11 July 1862 (12 Stat. 532), the Secretary of the Treasury received authorization to purchase machinery and employ the staff necessary to manufacture currency at the Treasury. It was not until 1877 (19 Stat. 353) that the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was given funding for labor, paper, transportation, and other expenses with the provision that all work be conducted on site, and for a price commensurate with that of the private bank note companies. On 1 October 1877, the BEP took over the production of both United States Note and National Bank Note production.<sup>[17]</sup></p>
        <h2 id="p3">National Bank Notes</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>“TO ARTISTS, ENGRAVERS AND OTHERS – Designs for National Currency Notes are hereby invited, of the denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, $500 and $1,000, to be issued under the Act of Congress authorizing a National Currency, approved 25 February 1863”.<sup>[18]</sup> Salmon Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, placed this classified notice in late March, 1863. Other than describe some of the required features of each note (e.g., legal wording, placement of Treasury signatures, etc.), the only direction given to prospective applicants was that submissions must be original (i.e., they cannot have ever been illustrated on U.S. currency) and that "the designs must be national in their character".<sup>[18]</sup> It is uncertain how many proposals were submitted, or what was involved in the selection process, but the final decision was to draw heavily on the use of historic American images which adorn the Capitol Rotunda.&nbsp;<sup>[nb 1]</sup> The motivation for this selection was two-fold: educationally it would circulate images depicting important scenes from American history while at the same time enhancing the security of the note by involving highly complex engravings.<sup>[20]</sup></p>
        <p>By July 1863, contracts were signed with American Bank Note Company (ABNCo) and Continental Bank Note Company (CBNCo) (which would later be absorbed by ABNCo) to design, engrave, and begin printing National Bank Notes.<sup>[21]</sup> ABNCo was contracted for the $20, $50, and $100 denominations,[22] CBNCo was contracted for the $5 and $10 denominations,<sup>[23]</sup> and National Bank Note Company contracted for the designs for the $2, $500, and $1,000 denominations.<sup>[24]</sup> The contract descriptions addresses each denomination individually and specifies which image from the Capitol Rotunda should be used for the reverse and what type of vignettes should be on the obverse (with specific names).&nbsp;<sup>[nb 2]</sup></p>
        <p>The first National Bank Notes were issued on 21 December 1863.<sup>[17]</sup></p>
